A typical HTML file contains <i>DOCTYPE</i> which defines that the document is html document. Following that there is a html tag inside which there will be two sections namely head and body section. Head section contains meta data about our page like title ,links for external stylesheets and js files.Body section is where we write actual content to be dispalyed on the page,which includes headings,paragraphs,images,links to other pages,lists,tables. Besides that we can also bold and italisize text as we do in text editors.We can also make some stylings by using style attribute inside a tag. Moreover, it is easy to learn.</p>
